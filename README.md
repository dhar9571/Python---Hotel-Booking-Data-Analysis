This is my EDA Capstone project on Almabetter's Python module on Hotel Booking Dataset.

What did you know about your dataset?

1. The dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, number of available parking spaces etc.
2. This data has 119390 Rows and 32 Columns.
3. This dataframe has 488 null values in "country" column, 16340 null values in "agent" column and 112593 null values in company column.
4. Null values in "agent" columns predicts that bookings were done directly instead through any agent.

PROBLEM OVERVIEW

1. The hotel industry is a highly competitive and dynamic environment, where the demand for rooms is constantly changing based on a variety of factors, such as location, seasonality, events, and economic conditions. Hotels need to understand these factors to effectively manage their room inventory and pricing, and maximize their revenue.
2. One way for hotels to gain insights into their business is to analyze their booking data. The booking data can provide information about the demand for rooms, the most popular destinations, the length of stay, the booking lead time, and the booking channel. By analyzing this data, hotels can make informed decisions about room inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts.
3. However, the booking data is often complex and large, and requires specialized skills and tools to analyze effectively. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights and patterns in the booking data that can help hotels make data-driven decisions and optimize their business operations.


Business Objective?

1. Discover important factors that govern the bookings.
2. Causes of booking cancellations across various aspects.
3. Suitable time to book hotel.


What do you suggest the client to achieve Business Objective ?
1. Greater the lead time, higher chances of cancellation. Therefore, the cancellation policy should be altered accordingly so that cancellation rate can be reduced.
2. No deposit type has the most cancellations. Therefore, changes in the no deposit type method are crucial so that cancellations can be reduced.
3. Most of the customers are transient types from European countries with offline/online TA segment. Therefore, these customers should be provided with more perks/offers 4. if booking through offline/online TA, so the bookings can be increased.
5. June to August are the peak months in which bookings are higher even though the prices are higher during this period. Therefore, if prices are reduced for both the hotels, more bookings can be made by the customers.


Conclusion
1. A minimum amount should be charged for long lead time to reduce the chances of cancellations.
2. There should be a fixed amount to be charged instead of no deposit to reduce to cancellations.
3. To improve the number of bookings, transient customers from European regions who come in peak season through offline/online TA, should be provided with extra benefits/offers/perks in order to improve number of bookings.
